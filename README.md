# WanderSync: A Collaborative Travel Management System

## Introduction
**WanderSync** is an application that simplifies the process of creating and managing travel itineraries for solo and group travelers. With features such as real-time collaboration, secure account creation, and seamless integration of travel details, WanderSync redefines the travel planning experience.

The app allows users to:
- Organize locations, transportation, accommodations, dining reservations, and personal notes.
- Collaborate in real-time with group members to create shared travel agendas.
- Synchronize updates seamlessly among all group members.

## Design & Architecture
WanderSync leverages the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern for clean separation of concerns, scalability, and efficient data binding. Firebase is utilized for secure user authentication and database storage, ensuring real-time collaboration capabilities. The Observer Pattern was used for real-time data updates across multiple user session, and the Strategy Pattern was pplied for flexible handling of user-specific data, such as accommodations and dining preferences.
